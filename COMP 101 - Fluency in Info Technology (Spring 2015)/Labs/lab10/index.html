		    There are a number of ways to make your website more engaging
		    for your users.
		    First, you can add multi-media to your site.
		    This can be photos, audio, or videos.
		    The other possibility is to add widgets.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Widgets are small pieces of code that can be integrated into your site. 
		    Each widget functions as a program that performs a certain function. 
		    There are different types of widgets available 
		    and the best part is that they are all pretty easy to use, 
		    just copy and paste the widget code onto your site to see them work.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Widgets can be used to track visitors, to handle RSS feeds, 
		    to provide fun or useful tools, as well as to display advertisements. 
		    Usually widgets are employed on a site to enhance the online experience for the users 
		    on your site.
		</p>
		<p>
		    There are a lot of widgets that provide weather information, news headlines,
		    time or date. 
		    There are also social bookmarking widgets that can be used to promote your site. 
		    Widgets are also a good source of making some money by using advertising widgets 
		    that can be used to display google ads etc.
