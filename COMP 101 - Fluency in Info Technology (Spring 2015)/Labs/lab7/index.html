                    A float is a decorated platform, either built on a vehicle or towed behind one,
                    which is a component of many festive parades,
                    such as those of Mardi Gras in New Orleans,
                    the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the Key West Fantasy Fest parade, 
                    Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, and the Tournament of Roses Parade.
                    For the Tournament of Roses Parade, floats are decorated entirely in flowers.
                    Parade floats were first introduced in the Middle Ages when churches used pageant
                    wagons as movable scenery for passion plays.

                    An ice cream float is a beverage that consists of ice cream in a soft drink.
                    The traition float as the scoop of ice cream to the top of the soda an oes not mix them.
                    There are a number of well-known combinations with specific names.
                    The <em>root beer flost</em> is traditionally made with vanilla ice cream and root beer.
                    In the United States and Canada, the A&amp;W restaurant chain is well known
                    for their root beer floats.
                    A <em>Boston cooler</em> is typically composed of Vernors Ginger Ale and vanilla ice cream.
                    An <em>orange whip</em> consists of vanilla ice cream and orange soda.

                <h2>Swimming Float</h2>
                <img class="dog" src="dog_tubing.jpg" alt="dog tubing">
                <p>
                    A swimming float is often used for young children who are beginning to
                    learn how to swim or during exercise for therapeutic or training purposes.
                    These devices, which come in many shapes and types, are used to aid them with buoyancy.
                    Common floats for children are inflatable rings (where the user swims in the middle of it)
                    and inflatable armbands.
                    After being inflated through a valve, they are much less dense than water
                    because they are composed mainly of air.
                    Swimming float-assisted can be more difficult than swimming without the float,
                    because if the float is held in front of the swimmer a more vigorous workout
                    for the legs.
                    A variation known as the "pool noodle" is a long thin cylinder with a hollow core.

                <h2>Economic Float</h2>

                    In economics, float is duplicate money present in the banking system during the
                    time between a deposit being made in the recipient's account and the money being
                    deducted from the sender's account.
                    Float is most obvious in the time delay between a check being written
                    and the funds to cover that check being deducted from the payer's account.
                    Once the payee deposits the check in his account,
                    his bank immediately credits (increases) his account, assuming that the payer's
                    bank will ultimately send the funds. Until the payer's bank actually sends the funds,
                    both the payer and the payee have the "same" money in both of their accounts.
                    Once the payee's bank notifies the payer's bank,
                    the funds will be removed from the payer's account
                    and the check will be considered to have cleared the bank.
