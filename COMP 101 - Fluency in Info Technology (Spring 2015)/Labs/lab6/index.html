            <p>
                Groundhog Day is celebrated in the United States each year on February 2and.
                On this day the groundhog awakens from a long winter's nap and goes outside of his den
                to see if he sees his shadow. 
                If the groundhog sees his shadow (a sunny morning), there will be six more weeks of winter.
                He then returns to his den and goes back to sleep.
                If, however, he does not see his shadow (cloudy days),
                spring is just around the corner.
