                Valentine's Day is a celebration of love and lovers.
                The roots of Valentine's Day goes back to ancient times,
                when people paid honor to the Roman God of Fertility.
                This was known as the Feast of Lupercalia, and was celebrated even then on February 14th.
                Chocolates and jewelry are the big hits of this holiday as is romantic dinners.
