            <p>
                Presidents' Day is an American holiday celebrated on the third Monday in February.
                Originally established in 1885 in recognition of President George Washington,
                it is still officially called Washington's Birthday by the federal government.
                Traditionally celebrated on February 22 (Washington's actual day of birth),
                the holiday became popularly known as Presidents' Day after it was moved as part of
                1971's Uniform Monday Holiday Act, an attempt to create more three-day weekends
                for the nation's workers.
