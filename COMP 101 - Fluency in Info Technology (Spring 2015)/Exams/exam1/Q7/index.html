            West House:
            The one-story brick building was built in 1935 
            by Rutherfordton textile magnate Kenneth Tanner  
            to house his sons when they entered the University.

            New West:
            Built in 1859, New West was so
            named because it was much newer than Old West, which dated
            from 1823.
