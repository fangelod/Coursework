        <h1>Outer Bank Lighthouses</h1>
            <p>
               For more than two centuries, lighthouses have guarded the Outer Banks coast.
               Generations of seaborne travellers and mariners have sought the comfort of these beacons'
               reassuring light as they navigated perilous channels and shoals that mark the
               Graveyard of the Atlantic.
            </p>
            <p>
               There are 5 lighthouses on the Outer Banks
            </p>
                <ul>
                   <li>Bodie Island</li>
                   <li>Currituck Beach</li>
                   <li>Cape Hatteras</li>
                   <li>Ocracoke</li>
                   <li>Roanoke Marshes</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Cape Hatteras</h2>
                <p>
                   The Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, also known as America's Lighthouse,
                   is the tallest brick beacon in the country standing 208 feet.
                   The familiar black and white spiral-striped landmark serves as a warning to
                   mariners of submerged and shifting sandbars, known as the Diamond Shoals, 
                   which extend almost twenty miles off
                   Cape Hatteras into the Atlantic Ocean. 
                </p>
            <h2>Ocracoke</h2>
                <p>
                   The Ocracoke Lighthouse is North Carolina's oldest operating lighthouse.
                   In 1798, a 54-foot wooden tower was built on the point of Ocracoke Inlet to mark the channel.
                   Soon afterwards, the inlet shifted, rendering the lighthouse ineffective.
                   It was replaced by a light vessel in the inlet in 1820,
                   but by 1822 this structure was rendered useless yet again by shifting sands,
                   and Congress authorized the funding to build the present tower,
                   which stands 75 feet tall and shines 14 miles out to sea.
                </p>
            <h2>Bodie Island</h2>
                <p>
                   Bodie Island, originally spelled (and pronounced) Body, 
                   is named after the family who owned the land, 
                   but folklore would have it that the name resulted from the many shipwrecked bodies that washed ashore. 
                   Rising 165 feet and painted with striking black and white stripes, 
                   picture-perfect Bodie Island Lighthouse is actually the third attempt to illuminate the 
                   perilous stretch of coast between Cape Hatteras and Currituck Beach.
                   The lighthouse, built using the same innovative foundation as Hatteras, became operational 
                   1n 1872.
                </p>
            <h2>Currituck Beach</h2>
                <p>
                   This red-brick lighthouse towers is located in Corolla Village. 
                   To distinguish the Currituck Beach Lighthouse from other regional lighthouses, 
                   its exterior was left unpainted,
                   exposing the vast number of bricks involved in its construction.
                   Visitors can climb the 220 steps of the winding staircase to the top of the 162-foot tall lighthouse.
                   Construction began on the lighthouse in 1872 and was completed 3 years later.
                </p>
            <h2>Roanoke Marshes</h2>
                <p>
                   The Roanoke Marshes Lighthouse is the most overlooked of the Outer Banks lighthouses 
                   and, unlike the other four, is not an original.
                   It is a replica of the original lighthouse that was constructed in 1877 at the southern entrance 
                   of the Croatan Sound in Wanchese,
                   This lighthouse was actually the third to carry the name.
                   The first two, 
                   also constructed in the 1800s, were lost soon after they were constructed and put into service.
                   The original white, square structure was completed in 1877 and was supported by seven screw piles. 
                   After being decommissioned in 1955,  
                   the original lighthouse was lost in the sound 
                   during an attempt to move it inland to private property.
