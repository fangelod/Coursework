            <h1>March Madness</h1>
            <p>
                We all know that March Madness refers to the NCAA Basketball Championship.
                But what other forms of March Madness are there?
                Consider the following "holidays" that occur in March!
                If you click on the holiday, you can find out when it is celebrated.

                    One thing that sets man apart from many other species on the planet is an opposable thumb.
                    It allows us to do many things that other creatures can't do.  
                    Now imagine what it would be like if your pet had thumbs.

                <dt onclick="alert('Middle Name Pride Day is March 10');">Middle Name Pride Day</dt>
                <dd>
                    Middle Name Pride Day honors the seldom used middle name that often sets you apart from others.
                    It was selected with care, so you should be proud of it.
                </dd>
                <dt onclick="alert('Worship of Tools Day is March 11');">Worship of Tools Day</dt>
                <dd>
                    To some, a tool is a natural extension of their arm.
                    So, Worship of Tools Day is a logical day of celebration.
                    Celebrate today by working with tools.

                <dt onclick="alert('Dumbstruck Day is March 15');">Dumbstruck Day</dt>
                <dd>
                    Dumbstruck Day is a day to be totally dumbstruck over the things you see, hear and read.
                    You may easily be dumbstruck to read that someone created this special day.
                </dd>
                <dt onclick="alert('Extraterrestrial Abductions Day is March 20');">Extraterrestrial Abductions Day</dt>
                <dd>
                    Keep one eye on the sky.
                    And, be ready to duck, dodge, and to hide.
                    UFO's may be everywhere, looking to abduct humans.
                    If you are not careful, perhaps they will find you!

                    Now here's a day that just about everybody can relax and enjoy.
                    It's a day to do anything and everything.....except what you're supposed to do today.
