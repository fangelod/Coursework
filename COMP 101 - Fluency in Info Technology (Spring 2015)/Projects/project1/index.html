                    Many advancements have been made to computers throughout time.
                    Today, computers have many applications in the real world.
                    Many professions require the use of computers for it to be effectively performed.
                    Some may not even realize the importance of it in today's society.

                    The real world application in focus on this page will be how computers are involved in the area of medicine.
                    Computers have revolutionized the medical field.
                    The level of health care available now would not be possible without them.
                    It has done various things for it such as:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Improved diagnostics</li>
                    <li>Enhanced the effectiveness of procedures</li>
                    <li>Streamlined research</li>
                    <li>Decreased mortality rates</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    In the mordern field of medicine, computers are crucial for it to run.
                    Systems dedicated to monitoring vitals of patients makes things much easier for nurses and medical personnel.
                    Databases of patient information rely on computers to be stored locally and communicated between different hospitals.
                    Doing any of these tasks with just human power would come with human error, costing lives.
                </p>

                    Computers play a huge role in diagnostics.
                    Without them, we wouldn't know what is happening in our bodies.
                    Before computers and imaging tools, open surgery was the only method of determining what was going on in the body.
                    Computers have made diagnostics non-invasive and doesn't put the patient in immediate danger.
                    Here are some examples of diagnostic tests that are used today that require the use of computers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>X-Ray</li>
                    <li>CT Scan</li>
                    <li>MRI</li>
                    <li>Ultrasound</li>
                    <li>Endoscopy</li>
                </ul>
                <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
                
            <h2 id="here3">Outside The Hospital</h2>
                <p>
                    The medical field doesn't all happen in hospitals.
                    Research in medicine goes on in different universities and research facilities.
                    Medicine has advanced this far because computers have streamlined research.
                    Computers give doctors the tools that they need to make new discoveries and share them with the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To observe many of the pathogens that invade our bodies, computers are needed to examine its structure and its behavior.
                    To study the effect of different medicine on our DNA and our bodies, computers make it much easier to perform these tests.
                    To communicate with different doctors around the world, computers make it possible to talk face-to-face without even being in the same room.
                    To store all the information of medicine that has ever been discovered, computers make it possible to keep it all and relieving the burden of someone remembering it all.
                    Computers have a huge importance in the field of medicine.
