            <p>
                The Philippines is home to many natural landmarks, of which are one of the attractions of tourists that come to the country.
                The background image found on this website is an image of the Banaue Rice Terraces.
                These terraces were carved into the mountains of Ifugao 2,000 years ago.
                It is known as the "Eighth Wonder of the World" to Filipinos.
                The Philippines is a major rice exporter and is 8th largest rice producer in the world.
