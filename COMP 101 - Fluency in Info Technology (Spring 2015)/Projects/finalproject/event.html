                A big part of what Kasama does is host montly events.
                The events that happen each month has varied from year to year but there are a select few that are hosted every year.
                In order to attend these events, people must pay membership dues that last the entire year.
                If they choose not to pay dues, they must pay for each individual event.
                Membership dues are $5 for the entire year, but $2 for each event.
                Considering there are at least 8 events for the years, you'd being saving a lot of money just to pay dues instead!
                Below you can find the events that we host every year:

            <img class="hap4" src="images/wele.jpg" alt="Kasama White Elephant">
            <p>
                Our white elephant is just that, white elephant.
                For those that don't know, white elephant is a gift exchanging game where each person that participates buys a gift.
                Everyone has a number, which determines the order that they go in.
                Each person either randomly chooses a gift or can steal a gift that has already been chosen.
                Once a gift has been stolen three times, it cannot be stolen again.
                Once everyone has gone, the game is over.
                Kasama hosts white elephant right before winter break.

            <p>
                Fear factor is an event that Kasama hosts every year that introduces how weird Filipino cuisine can get.
                We serve popular dishes that seem disgusting to the normal bystander like "dinuguan" or "balut."
                And of course we have to make a competition out of it.
