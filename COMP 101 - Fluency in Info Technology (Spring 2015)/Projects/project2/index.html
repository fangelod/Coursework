                    Basketball is a team sport where teams of five try to shoot a ball through what is called a "hoop."
                    The sport is played on a rectangular court that consists of two hoops.
                    A team can score by getting the ball through their opponent's hoop.
                    The amount of points received from each score varies depending on the distance from the hoop that the shot was taken from.
                    The only exception to this rule is what is known as free throws.
                    Free throws are taken as a result of a player being fouled while attempting a shot or if the opposing team reaches a certain number of team fouls.
                    Each free throw made is worth one point.
